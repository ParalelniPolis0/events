    • What we'll do

    https://www.facebook.com/events/731760587198086/


    At this lecture we will go through the necessary steps to create a
    transaction system which functions without any central authority. In this
    process, we will explain what blockchain is and what role it plays in
    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We will also explain the role of miners.
    In the end, we will discuss use cases of blockchain and areas where it is
    not useful at all.

    The lecture is a bit more technical, but still easy to understand for the
    general public.


    Jan Hubík is a cryptoanarchist and a hacker. He has formal education in
    multiple fields from physics to finance. Since 2013, he has been deeply
    interested in cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems from many points of
    view - from mining, investment, business use, to impact on society. He earns
    his living as a crypto-technology consultant and data scientist. Jan is a
    member of the Paralelni Polis supervisory board, where he focuses on the
    Institute of Cryptoanarchy. He produces multiple programmes, manages part of
    the finances and devotes the rest of his free time to spreading the word
    about cryptoanarchy.

    All-out strong polarization. Repeating tension between collectivists and
    individuals.

    This time with a new difference: Crypto technologies. Liberating us. Making
    us entirely responsible for all our decisions.


    This was short description of our Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis 2018. So
    let’s look back and see our hackers congress from different point of view
    with Tomáš Kolman and Jan Hubík.


    Paralelní Polis and Institute of Cryptoanarchy are still developing and
    working on something new. During #HCPP18 we were using for the first time
    our brand new streaming studio for making interviews. #HCPP18 Summary will
    take place at this studio so you can enjoy the new concept. Everybody is
    invited to come and listen to the speech directly at the studio.

    Through the concept of “silent disco” (headphones all around the place for
    listening the speech at a real time) you can listen to the speech while
    sitting in our Café sipping a good coffee and meeting new people.


    Tomáš Kolman is main coordinator of #HCPP. He will be talking about main
    ideas of #HCPP and how we are able to fill them.


    Jan Hubík is member of Supervisory Board of Paralelní Polis. He was
    moderator of many speakers on last hackers congress and as one of main guys
    behind this whole project he will be talking about headlines of #HCPP18 and
    what we were able to accomplish in comparison to past years.

    At first glance Peter lives the life of a typical European teenager – he
    lives with his parents, has a pretty girlfriend, he got into college.
    However, his real life is elsewhere – as the head of a paramilitary called
    “Slovenskí branci” that recruits hundreds of Slovak teenagers with the
    silent approval of the authorities. The group’s goal is simple - to prepare
    for a war time and create a model totalitarian-like community based on
    military drill, obedience and fear. Peter dreams that one day he will be
    able to convince the entire society - as a great politician.


    Film screening will be followed by discussion with director.

    We are pleased to announce the visit of one of the best hackers in the past.
    Patrick Kroupa will come to Prague.

    An entrepreneur, writer, hacker, and activist. During the 1980's he was a
    member of the Legion of Doom, one of the most influential hacking groups in
    the history of technology.


    Having grown bored of accessing systems that didn't belong to him, in 1991
    he co-founded MindVox, the first Internet Service Provider in New York, the
    third in the United States, and one of the first 500 dot coms ever
    registered.


    The speech will be about a historical first-person perspective starting with
    the "golden age" of cyberspace and the hacker and pirate underground of the
    1980s, the evolution of BBS systems into social networks on the internet,
    the birth of cypherpunk and PGP, eventually evolving into cryptocurrency,
    the darknet, and disruptive technologies bringing with them the possibility
    of a decentralized world where technology enables and preserves personal
    freedoms despite living within an all-encompassing surveillance planet,
    which seems to be incompatible with the concepts of anonymity, "freedom" and
    "privacy."

    wide publicity. Blockchain technologies are already in our lifes and we are
    proud that this new and fresh ideas of combination were born in #Ukraine.


    What we have done?


    This is an international event that started in Ukraine in October 2017 with
    1st Blockchain Art Hackathon where blockchain community worked hand-by-hand
    with artists to turn Blockchain ideas into pieces of art. Specialists,
    famous Bitcoin users and crypto enthusiasts gathered together with 30
    Ukrainian artists to create a brand-new, innovative trend in art. After the
    detailed acquaintance with the technology, the artists worked in the
    enclosed space for 48 hours to create their masterpieces.

    Art objects, created as a result of the hackathon, were presented at the
    exhibitions in the Ukraine. Each art object in the collection was tokenized.

    Copyrights were secured using Blockchain technology.

    NOTHING TO HIDE is a documentary researched and directed by a pair of
    Berlin-based journalists, Mihaela Gladovic and Marc Meillassoux. As
    producers, we have assembled a multi-national team to question the growing,
    puzzling and passive public acceptance of massive corporate and governmental
    incursions into individual and group privacy and rights. All too often the
    mainstream mantra has become “Surveillance? I have NOTHING TO HIDE!”

    Come with us to celebrate Pizza Bitcoin Day! On Tuesday 22.5. it will be
    exactly 8 years when the first bitcoin payment was made in the real world.
    It will be celebrated (of course) by pizza.


    It is called the most expensive pizza in history. Just eight years ago, at
    the bitcointalk.org forum, florid programmer Laszlo Hanyecz wrote an
    unprecedented offer of his time: "I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of
    pizzas ... for two big ones to keep me on the next day. If you are
    interested, let me know."


    The evening will be held in the spirit of informal discussion. You will meet
    Czech bitcoin authorities. All fans and opponents of cryptocurrencies are
    welcome.

    • What we'll do

    https://www.facebook.com/events/1073040696171555/


    Can cryptocurrencies be money? What are the risks of using them and
    investing in them? Is Bitcoin a bubble? Or a scam? A Ponzi scheme? Can
    cryptocurrencies become eco-friendly and retain the security they offer?
    What can we expect in the future?


    Those and other issues will be discussed at a video conference with live
    audience in Paralelni Polis.


    The discussants are:

    Prof. Steve Keen - winner of Revere Award for Economics for predicting the
    Great Recession and author of Debunking Economics and Can we avoid another
    financial crisis,

    Frances Copolla – Forbes contributor on banking, finance, economics and
    cryptocurrency,

    Josef Tětek – Business analyst, economist and cryptocurrency expert,

    Ondřej Pilný – ICO specialist and co-founder of ICOindex.

    • What we'll do

    https://www.facebook.com/events/159793197887670/


    In January, Bitcoin celebrated its 9 years of existence, and its legacy that
    money can work completely differently, freely and without state supervision,
    will probably remain with us. Do you hear about Bitcoin for the first time,
    or you had no time to get to know it better? - Come to the lecture in
    Paralelní Polis and let yourself be introduced to its foundations.


    Where did Bitcoin come from and how does it work? Why is it a revolutionary
    invention that is comparable to the importance of the invention of the
    Internet. What is Bitcoin good for today and what can I expect from it in
    the future? Where can I buy Bitcoin and where can I use it?


    After the introductory lecture there will be time for your questions.


    The lecture will be led by Jan Hubík. Jan is a technology enthusiast and a
    hacker. He has formal education in multiple fields from physics to finance.
    Since 2013, he is deeply interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain
    systems from many points of view - from mining, investment, business use, to
    impact on society. He earns his living as a crypto-technology consultant and
    data scientist. Jan is a member of the Paralelni Polis supervisory board,
    where he focuses on the Institute of Cryptoanarchy. He produces multiple
    programmes, manages part of the finances and devotes the rest of his free
    time to spreading the word about cryptoanarchy.
