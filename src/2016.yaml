    Bitsquare is the first decentralized, open and secure Bitcoin exchange with
    privacy by design. — Bitsquare is not a company. Rather, it is implemented
    as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization with distributed ownership.


    During the meetup, Manfred Karrer, the creator of Bitsquare, will cover the

    Meetup is held in Czech, but you are welcome to visit us at our Bitcoin
    Coffee and have your first coffee for bitcoin anyway.


    Ambicí projektu Hivemind je předpovídat budoucnost pomocí decentralizované
    kolektivní mysli postavené na bitcoinovém blockchainu. Roger Ver prohlásil
    Hivemind za nejdůležitější projekt od Bitcoinu. Podobně i Tomáš Forgáč, host
    našeho setkání, jej považuje za jednu z mála skutečně významných aplikací
    blockchainové technologie. Proč? To se dozvíte v jeho přednášce již toto
    úterý.

    Finally a meetup in English! Let's watch a short documentary The Bitcoin
    Gospel and have a hangout with Roger Ver aka Bitcoin Jesus!


    The documentary looks at the history, the ideologies, and the conflict
    between the politics of the early-adopters and the VCs/entrepreneurs pushing
    to take Bitcoin mainstream. Roger Ver is ex-US citizen who has been a long
    time proponent of voluntaryism and is most well know for his work promoting
    Bitcoin.
